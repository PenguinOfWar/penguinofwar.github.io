  no strings; especially among the big players. Have a look if you are interested

# Motivation
For the last few months, the constantly shifting nature of events around the world has truly been staggering. To name just a few:

1. There have been protests in Hong Kong
2. Australia caught fire
3. WW3 nearly started in the Persian Gulf
4. Iran shot down a passenger jet, killing all 176 people on board
4. A huge volcano erupted
5. The president of the USA was impeached
6. COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organisation
7. The Brexit transition started

And that was just January.

Since then, one of the biggest topics of 2020 that has occupied the publics attention has been the Black Lives Matter movement and the related events happening in the US and around the world.

As an interesting side story to these world-changing events, I started to notice how tech companies were responding to being in the spotlight. Some, like Twitter, were relatively quick to take measures, implementing fact checking and banners to combat fake news and removing outspokenly racist people. Others, like Facebook, are suffering a fairly major blowback from both their users and advertisers for being perceived to be protecting hate speech.

This got me thinking about my impact on companies and platforms like these. Whether there is money involved or not in your transactions with a company, you are contributing both monetary value and validation to them and their actions.

I started to look critically at the apps I was using on a daily basis.

* What was I using them for?
* Did I pay?
* Where is the value for me?
* Where is the value for the company?

The last question was the one I focused on the most. Putting everything else aside, what was the company that provided the app or service getting out of it? And what were they doing with it?

# The Price Of Free
Few things in life are truly free. And as the saying goes...

> If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold - blue_beetle, 2010

And these days, sometimes even if you are paying you're still the product. Maybe it's time we revised that one.

> If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold. Except when you're paying, and you're still the product being sold. #doubledipping - Me, 2020

A lot of the apps I found myself using were these free services provided by the biggest companies in the world. I was using Google's Chrome browser to check my Google Mail to check my YouTube subscription emails and then Googling how to reset my Google Nest.

At least I don't have an Android phone... any more.

With the exception of the Nest (which I did pay for - great little gadget), I hadn't paid for any of this. So what were Google getting out of it?

Data, or more specifically, the ability to leverage it to make money from your personal data that you hadly freely given up when you registered, in many cases not understanding (because seriously, who reads T&C docs these days) exactly what you'd signed up for.

> Thankfully, in Google's case, it's pretty obvious. The bulk of Google's 162 billion dollar revenue in 2019 came from its proprietary advertising service, Google Ads. 

> When you use Google to search for anything from financial information to local weather, you’re given a list of search results generated by Google’s algorithm. The algorithm attempts to provide the most relevant results for your query, and, along with these results, you may find related suggested pages from a Google Ads advertiser.

* Google’s AdSense program allows websites not affiliated with Google to use Google display advertising on their sites.
* A large portion of Google's revenue comes from advertising. 

But Google is easy, what about others? Let's take a look at where exactly big companies get their money from, and what they do with it.
# The Big Players

{% include image.html path="posts/top-20-tech-companies.jpg" path-detail="posts/top-20-tech-companies.jpg" alt="Top 20 Tech Companies" %}

The following is a list that mixes both company names and service names (e.g. Google and YouTube). I will not list everything that these companies or apps do to make money (or we'll be here all day) - just the ones relevant to the topic at hand.

Nothing in the below list is presented neutrally. Everything is cross-referenced and you can find the necessary information on respective wiki pages or by using your preferred search engine.

# Trust No One (Not Even Yourself)
{% include image.html path="posts/trust.jpg" path-detail="posts/trust.jpg" alt="Trust No One" %}

Okay, so at this point you're probably thinking... what is the point?

The landscape of who is where and doing what in 2020 is extremely difficult to untangle, to know who you are dealing with, where the money (or your data, or both) is going, and what you should do about is getting increasingly hard. 

So my point is:  there **are** things you can do as an individual to at least get a handle on things.

* Trust no one (not even yourself)
* If something is too good to be true, it probably is
* It's absolutely worth being informed about the choices you are making, even if the choice doesnt have an upfront cost

And if you do decide to trust someone, remember the old Russian rhyming proverb.

> Doverey, no proverey

Trust but verify.

# My Journey So Far
To come full circle back to the start of this post; what have I been doing about it?

1. I've deleted my Facebook account (along with Messenger)
2. I've deleted WhatsApp and replaced it with Signal and Telegram (though there are some concerns about [Telegram's encryption not being end-to-end](https://restoreprivacy.com/telegram-messenger/#:~:text=The%20concern%20about%20Telegram's%20E2E,your%20devices%20and%20Telegram's%20servers.&text=However%2C%20Telegram%20can%20read%20chat,of%20messages%20at%20the%20servers.))
3. I've begun migrating my emails from Gmail to Apple mail
4. I've ditched Google Chrome for Edge and Firefox

### Next Steps and Gotchas
I've only just started my self-audit of app and company choices, but already there are some caveats and oncoming blockers

1. I still have Instagram as I do enjoy using it, however I will eventually get rid of this too
2. I am keeping Twitter for the time being
3. I would love to step away from Facebook (the company) entirely, however they are the parent company for Oculus and I love my Oculus Quest too much...
4. Google Search is so good I'm struggling to find a footing with DuckDuckGo
5. I don't even know where to start with Amazon, and that's before we get to my reliance on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Some of these are easy (I should just man up and delete my Instagram already but where else am I going to post pictures of my dog?), and some are hard.

The hardest of these will be the ubiquitousness of Amazon. I use Prime Now for my shopping, I order everything else on Amazon for next day convenience, I watch Prime Video a lot as they have some very fine originals, and my entire financial situation is inexorably tied to delivering platforms and apps through AWS.

The journey continues.
